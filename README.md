## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### Continued development

I would like to work on aligning elements. I had trouble on how to align the card relative to the body.

### Useful resources

- [MDN margin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin) - This helped me center the card horizontally.
- [MDN padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/padding) - This helped me how to put space between a parent element and its child element.
